## Dev Install Instructions

1. Install Node.js [Here](https://nodejs.org/en)  
2. Install Android Studio [Here](https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAC-IOZlMfeQAjLmqKrspCVlYU7fr4&gclid=Cj0KCQiA88a5BhDPARIsAFj595jUz8aGqI65fDdK3ZpqDA1pz140tnzHJ69qZ4B3gZL4gsL5vVhV9B0aAnkaEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)   (Optional, this for running an Android emulator)

### Command Line Setup

1. Open the command prompt and enter the following commands:
   - **Install Vue**  
     ```bash
     npm install -g @vue/cli
     ```

   - **Install Ionic and Capacitor**  
     ```bash
     npm install -g @ionic/cli @capacitor/assets
     ```

2. Navigate to the desired directory:
   - **Clone the repository**  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Sanmeet-EWU/cscd-488-490-project-save-farmers/tree/main/Source/savefarmer.git savefarmer
     ```

   - **Change to the project directory and run the app**  
     ```bash
     cd savefarmer && npm install && ionic serve
     ```

   *(This command should open the app in your browser. If it doesn't, ensure Vue and Ionic are installed correctly.)*

### Code Editing

You can now open the **entire folder** with a code editor such as VS Code (make sure to have the Vue, TypeScript, and Ionic extensions installed) to edit the code within the `src` folder.

# Emulator Instructions

1. In the project terminal, run the following commands:  
   *Ensure Android Studio is installed and open during the first run to build properly.*
   - **Add Capacitor Android files**  
     ```bash
     ionic cap add android
     ```

   - **Build Android**  
     ```bash
     ionic cap build android
     ```
     *(This should open Android Studio and build the emulator)*

   - **Run the Emulator**  
     ```bash
     ionic cap run
     ```
     *(This should launch the emulator. Note: It may take some time.)*

## Cypress Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Verify Cypress is installed:
    ```bash  
    npm install cypress
    
2. Ensure that the development server is running before starting Cypress:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   
By default, this serves the app at http://localhost:5173. You can change the base port in cypress.config.ts to match your local machine.

3. Run tests with Cypress:
    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e

4. Navigate to navigation.spec.ts to modify/view tests:

    ```bash
    cd savefarmer/tests/e2e/specs/navigation.spec.ts
